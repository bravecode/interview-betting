#### Info
- Typescript has been implemented because of its quality of life.
- For styling, I've used Tailwind.
- I'm aware that redux / redux-saga is an overkill for this size of an application. I just wanted to showcase my knowledge of it since it's very useful in bigger applications.

#### Improvements
Across code, I have made multiple notes in the places I think could be improved in the real-world application. Here I would list only a few improvements that I think are worth mentioning:

- UI & UX
	- Support Mobile Devices & Smaller Resolutions.
    - Accessibility Improvements.
    - Make Table component more universal (as well as other shared components).
    - ... and a lot more
- Other
	- Configure TSlint & Prettier to maintain code rules & quality.
